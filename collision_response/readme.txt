I have really tried with collision response with the torque, but eventually it did not work out, I can not find out where the problem is. 


I spend a lot of time, I have created at least 4 version of main, that has different structure. 
I would say I tried my best on this assignment and really hope that I could get some points for both part. 
But the collision without torque (only with translation) is very accurate. That's why I uploaded two videos.
First one:

thats the closest result I can get to with torque.

Second one:

without torque.

I uploaded both version, so you could tested both of them. 
(Note: the structure is different between those two files, you have to substitude all of my uploaded files)
