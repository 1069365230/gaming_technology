Create an empty scene with a plane at height 0.

Create a cube with a mass of 1 and let it fall three times (randomly rotated) onto the plane from 5 meter height.

You can use the results from the previous task for finding the contacts, or simply assume that each vertex of the box with y-coordinate <0 is a face-vertex contact.

Compute and resolve the collision between the cube and the plane. All necessary formulas can be found in the slides of the constrained motion lecture.
