I uploaded both A* and Dijkstra algorithm, and writed the nessesary part of console output into the txt file under each folder, which including every journeys and the total cost.
As well as mine source code under the corrisponding folder.
I think its nice to have a comparison between A* and Dijkstra, however if its not nessesary, please ignore the Dijkstra folder . Thanks alot:)
(I have a lot of between steps that I print in the console, but the reulst is at the end.)
